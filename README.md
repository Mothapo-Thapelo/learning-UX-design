# LEARNING USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN

## Techniques

### Collecting and analyzing user data

This step involves gathering data from the users of the system, best suitable using the same platform or technology users will be interacting with your system.
â€‹ Extracting and listing pain points and goals
This is the step where user and designers work together to identify problems and difficulties they may have with the system, or what they would expect from the system.

### Personas

They resemble live users and they are important since they model the actual user (s) who will be using the system on a daily basis, which helps designers and developers focus on important aspects that matter to the target audience.

### Ideation

This step involves creating multiple solutions for the pain points and goals that affect the personas we have through rough sketch and descriptions.

### Storyboard

This entails pieces of idealization put together to make the best user experience sense for our personas, which involves rough sketch of the story for our product that best resonates with our users.

### Prototyping

This is the phase that involves creating a quick mock up of the system we are about to start committing to for design and development, that the user can interact with for usability testing.

### Implementation Planning

This ensures that all capabilities are outline and grouped according to priorities and that the system is ready to start the design and development process.
